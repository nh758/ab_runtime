# The auth.log file is usually bind mounted in the ./logs/appbuilder directory
# So in your fail2ban jail.local config file:
#  [appbuilder]
#  filter = appbuilder
#  enabled = true
#  logpath = <your AB site directory>/logs/appbuilder/auth.log
#

[INCLUDES]

# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf
